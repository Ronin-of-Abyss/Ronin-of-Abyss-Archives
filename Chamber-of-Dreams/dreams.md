Okay very weird dream I just had. It starts with me and what I assume to be some friends exploring an abandoned school. The thing in such disrepair that we had to do parkour to get into the main part of the school. One thing I noticed is that when we were just about to reach that main area I started to blackout and then not.

Eventually we reach this main area. It consists of a concrete basketball court, some bleachers, and a few dumpsters along with a Rubbermaid trash can. It wasn't that interesting if a place until I heard a friend say that they found like three dead bodies, wrapped up black trash bags. We found two more under the bleachers. That's when the other person we were with started talking about how in 1992 a series of murders took place here when someone in the school administration snapped. To cover up the events the school was shutdown due to a war that took place during the murders. Apparently the dude killed himself and that was it.

However, that's not really the end as one of us found the supposed killer in the same condition as the others. That's impossible, you can't wrap yourself in a black trash bag and then kill yourself. Also the bodies were still warm. Finally, how did I know that one of the bodies was the supposed killer? We never opened the bags, am I the actual killer? Infighting began but I can't remember what was said. Eventually we picked up the bodies and tossed them into the Rubbermaid trash can.

Kind of a uncomfortable dream I just had. It starts with me at what I assume to be a tennis court. There are people practicing tennis and I meet a girl while practicing. Turns out she was an old friend of mine and things quickly got romantic. Eventually we go on a walk together and she lead me throughout the city and into what I guess was her house.

That's when things got strange. She started to walk through walls as if I was imaging her. After a while we entered a bathroom and we went under the bathtub. When I say went under I mean we both walked straight through the thing. I instantly get a feeling of dread and all feelings of joy disappear. The environment is now very dim and creepy compared to the realistic place I had just left. Freaked out I think "wake up". Sure enough I did but it was a false awakening.

I went about my normal business and tried to play a video game to take my mind off things. In the game I found a cult priest but I could hear the person breathing which was weird, because that usually isn't a detail most games have. Suddenly, I'm in a dark room and I hear a voice, kill all the targets before time runs out. That's when a bunch of what I can only describe as creatures start rushing towards me. Scared, I pick up a handgun and start shooting at them. I make my way through the building killing anything that moved. That is, until I come across something that I'm unable to shoot, the bullets just go through them. I think to myself, then they must be a ghost. Then I wake up for real this time.

This must sound like the rambling of a crazy person but it's the best way I can describe what I assume to be me going to heaven and then hell.

Definitely not as interesting of a dream tonight. All I can remember is going to some ritual in the woods. No clue why. 
In other dream related news, I've figured out how to trigger the dreams. If I sleep until 03:00 and go back to sleep at 05:00, I end up dreaming.

Another short dream this time. This time I was in a house, two floors and no lights were on. I was hanging out with a very attractive girl that I clearly had feelings for but I never got the courage to ask her out.

Once again, I had a short dream that revolved around a girl except this time I wasn't trying to ask her out, I was trying to get back together with her.

Had a crazy dream this time. So to start, there was a massive earthquake in the city where the dream took place and it's like there was something almost supernatural about it as it caused birds to fly backwards and other strange stuff like that. Then after that there was a pool party I never went to and I did parkour instead.
